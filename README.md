### 🌟 About Me
I’m a tech lead with a passion for **system design, architecture, and infrastructure automation**. My expertise lies in designing distributed systems, building developer-centric tools, and creating scalable, user-friendly solutions. From bare-metal infrastructure to abstracting complex systems into simple interfaces, I thrive on solving tough problems with creativity and precision.

Here’s a quick glimpse of what I’ve built over the years:
1. 🏗️ **Multi-tenant, distributed microservice architectures** for enterprise-grade ATS platforms.
2. ⚙️ **A workflow engine** that’s both developer-friendly and business-centric, featuring its own execution engine, schedulers, runners, and FaaS-like functionality.
3. 📬 **A highly scalable email system** syncing with enterprise providers like Microsoft Graph and Google Workspace.
4. 📊 **Dynamic table systems** with user-defined schemas and a JSON-based interface for instant, real-time frontend generation.
5. 🧠 **A unified logic engine** to handle dynamic conditions, drastically reducing code complexity and enabling reusable validation frameworks.
6. 🔐 **End-to-end authorization systems** that go beyond ABAC, incorporating business metrics, feature flagging, A/B testing, cost calculations, and more.

When I’m not building scalable systems or designing databases, I enjoy:
- 📚 Reading books
- ♟️ Playing chess (badly, but passionately)
- 🛠️ Ricing my Linux setup
- 🏋️‍♂️ Working out
- 🛠️ Over-engineering tools that “just look cool” 😎
